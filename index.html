        <h3>Welcome to the GEMTools library</h3>
		<p>
		The GEMTools library and command line tools is a project created to 
		simplify the usage of the <a href="http://algorithms.cnag.cat">GEM Mapper</a>
		in certain situations.
		</p>
		<h3>Licensing</h3>
		<p>
		The GEMTools library and the code hosted in the GEMTools Github repository
		is licensed under teh GPL, but please note that the GEM mapper itself is not.
		GEM is distributed under a double-licensing scheme and is free for non-commercial use.
		For details about the GEM licensing, please read the <a href="http://algorithms.cnag.cat/wiki/GEM:Non_commercial_binary_license">GEM non-commercial binary license</a>.
		</p>
		<h3>Documentation</h3>
		<p>We are still writing up on the extensive documentation, but take a
		look at the <a href="docs/rna_pipeline.html">RNASeq Pipeline Quickstart</a>
		guide.
		</p>
		<h3>Installation</h3>
		<p>
		The GEM-Tools library is distributed in three different flavors. You can get a
		statically compiled binary bundle if you are just interested in the command
		line tools. If you would like to explore the library functionality, you can
		install the latest release from<a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Gemtools">pypi</a>. 
		If you want to get the latest and greatest, you can clone the git repository 
		and install the library from source.
		</p>

		<h4>Static distribution</h4>
		<p>
		The GEM-Tools command line tools are bundled and distributed as a static binary
		bundle that includes all dependencies. You do not have to install any other
		software to use the binary bundle, but you will not be able to write your own
		python scripts. You are restricted to the available command line tools.
		</p>
		<p>
		*NOTE* that the GEM binaries are compiled with optimizations for i3 processors.
		We also provide a bundle for older CPU's that lack certain features. If you are
		not sure which package to download, i3 or core2, run the following command on
		the machine you want to install GEM-Tools:
		</p>
		<pre><code>python -c 'print ("i3 compatible" if set(["popcnt", "ssse3", "sse4_1", "sse4_2"]).issubset(set([f for sl in map(lambda x:x.split(), filter(lambda x:x.startswith("flags"), open("/proc/cpuinfo").readlines())) for f in sl])) else "No i3 support detected. Please use the core2 bundle")'</code></pre>

		<p>
		This command checks your ``/proc/cpuinfo`` file for the flags *popcnt*, *ssse3*,
		*sse4_1* and *sse4_2* are present. If that is the case, the CPU is supported by the
		i3 bundle. Otherwise use core2.
		</p>
		<p>
		The latest release can be downloaded here:
		</p>

				<a href="http://barnaserver.com/gemtools/releases/GEMTools-static-i3-1.6.tar.gz">GEM-Tools static binary bundle 1.6 for i3</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="http://barnaserver.com/gemtools/releases/GEMTools-static-core2-1.6.tar.gz">GEM-Tools static binary bundle 1.6 for core2</a>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Library distribution</h4>
		<p>
		In order to install the GEM-Tool library on your system and get access to the
		command line tools as well as the library functionality, you need to have a
		couple of dependencies installed. Unfortunately we can currently not install
		those dependencies for you. After all dependencies are installed, you have all
		the options to build and install the library in your local machine. These
		include:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			Install a released version from pypi
			</li>
			<li>
			Install form the git repository
			</li>
			<li>
			Build the library bundle
			</li>
			<li>
			Build the static binary distribution
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Dependencies</h4>
		<p>
		The C API needs to have gzlib and bzlib installed with header files.  Both
		libraries are used to transparently open compressed files. On a Debian/Ubuntu
		system the packages are libbz2-dev and zlib-dev.
		</p>
		<p>
		Here is an example of how you can install the necessary dependencies to build
		the C-library on a Debian/Ubuntu system: 
		</p>
		<pre><code>sudo apt-get install make gcc libbz2-dev</code></pre>
		<p>
		For the python part, the library will work both with Python 2.6 and Python 2.7.
		In order to compile the the C binding, you need to have
		<a href="http://www.cython.org">Cython</a> installed, as well as the python header files. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Here is an example of how you can install the necessary dependencies to build
		the Python library on a Debian/Ubuntu system: 
		</p>
		<pre><code>sudo apt-get install make gcc libbz2-dev python-dev</code></pre>
		<h4>Install from pypi</h4> 
		<p>
		Gemtools is distributed through pypi and you can install the latest released
		version using `pip` or `easy_install`. But please make sure you have all the
		dependencies installed first.
		</p>

		<p>As root:</p>
		<pre><code>pip install gemtools</code></pre>
		<p>As non-root user:</p>
		<pre><code>pip install gemtools --user</code></pre>

		<h4>Install from github</h4>
		<p>Please take a look at the readme for instruction on how to install
		directly from the <a href="http://github.com/gemtool/gemtools">GEMTool repository</a>
